## Programming 
### Mathematics for Computer Science
- [Mathematics for Computer Science](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.042/spring18/mcs.pdf) : This book covers elementary discrete mathematics for computer science and engineering. It emphasizes mathematical definitions and proofs as well as applicable methods. Topics include formal logic notation, proof methods; induction, well-ordering; sets, relations; elementary graph theory; integer congruences; asymptotic notation and growth of functions; permutations and combinations, counting principles; discrete probability. Further selected topics may also be covered, such as recursive definition and structural induction; state machines and invariants; recurrences; generating functions.
### Data Structures and Algorithms
- [Introduction to Algorithms](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition) : The latest edition of the essential text and professional reference, with substantial new material on such topics as vEB trees, multithreaded algorithms, dynamic programming, and edge-based flow.
- [Algorithms by Jeff Erickson](http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms) : The primary reference for two regularly-offered theoretical computer science courses at Illinois: CS 374 and CS 473.
- [Algorithms by Dasgupta, Papadimitriou and Vazirani](http://algorithmics.lsi.upc.edu/docs/Dasgupta-Papadimitriou-Vazirani.pdf) : This book evolved over the past ten years from a set of lecture notes developed while teaching the undergraduate Algorithms course at Berkeley and U.C. San Diego.
- [The Algorithms
](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms) : Open Source resource for learning Data Structures & Algorithms and their implementation in any Programming Language.
